### Basic Command Class mapping

Basic Command Class is mapped to Binary Switch CC

| Basic Command                          | Mapped Command                         |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Basic Set (Value)                      | Binary Switch Set (Value)              |
| Basic Report (Current Value, Duration) | Binary Switch Report (Value, Duration) |

X: For Z-Wave node count is equal to 5 and for Z-Wave Long Range it is 1.

## Usage of Buttons and LED Status

We are differentiating four different types of button presses. The following types are the same for the BTN0 and BTN1 on the WSTK board. The duration values can be configured under the config directory in app_button_press_config.h file in each generated application/project.

Please note external wakeup is not supported on button 1 in case of brd2603a and brd2603b.

## Firmware Update

This section will describe backward compatibility when upgrading the Switch On/Off application from one SDK to a newer version.

## CLI Support

In case CLI support is needed, please install zw_cli_common component to the project. Please note that the zw_cli_common component will modify the power consumption for every application.
